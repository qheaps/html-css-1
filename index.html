            <p>Hiesenberg is a man of legend, a god among us mere mortals that we can only hope to emulate to the
                slightest degree. Walter White, his real name, was a nobel prize winning highschool chemistry teacher, who, following his cancer diagnosis, decided
                to use the last years of his life sticking it to the man. It was then that he teamed up with his star student Jesse Pinkman, to cook. It was here, with
                his partner in crime Jesse, that he started tackling rot found in our society. He began with local drug dealers, supplanting their shady business and
                subpar product with his own (superior) product. He then moved on to the mexican cartels, and was beginning his crusade on a local group of neo-nazis
                (walter was notoriously anti facist) when the unjustified warrant for his arrest was given. It is then assumed he went into hiding elsewhere in the US
                 (he had no choice, he would never abandon New Mexico) until he returned to finish his crusade against the facist menace. He died following a shootout
                 with said facists, but he did get them all~! This page was created to honor his memory for future generations, and so the people he fought so hard
                 wouldn't get away with their misdeeds.
